ToDoList is delivered in a zip file to provide maximum control and flexibility 
over where the software is installed.

To install ToDoList, carry out the following steps:

1. Decide where you want to locate the software.

   This can be in 'Program Files (x86)', on a thumb drive, on another hard drive, 
   on a network, or even in the cloud using DropBox, GoogleDrive or OneDrive.
   
2. Create a 'ToDoList' folder in that location.

3. Unzip the download into that new 'ToDoList' folder.

4. Double-click 'ToDoList.exe' to start working.
